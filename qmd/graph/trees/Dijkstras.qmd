Let $G$ be a weighted connected graph $G$. Given two vertices $u,v$, by the least weight path from $u$ to $v$.

## Algorithm

Start with a vertex $u_0$. At the end of step $k-1$, will have a set $S_{k-1} \subseteq V(G)$, and a function $t$ defined on $S_{k-1} \cup N(S_{k-1})$. We want to define our function $t$ to tell us the minimum distance to $u$ on $S_{k-1}$. On $N(S_{k-1})$, $t$ will tell us the tentative distance to $u$.

At step $k$: Take a vertex $w$ in $N(S_{k-1}) \backslash S_{k-1}$
