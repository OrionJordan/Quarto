## Definition

The [**Banach Mazur game**]{style="color: blue"} (on $\mathbb{R}$) is a game with two players. Let $A \subseteq R$. The players take turns playing open sets one after another, with the condition that every open set is a subset of the set last played.
:::

While this seems like an arbitrary game, it has interesting properties and theorems associated with it.
