Partial differential equations is the study of functions with partial derivatives, and two or more independent variables. PDE's are incredibly useful models, and appear in almost every natural science.

The way that heat is transferred through material is given by a PDE, known as the Heat transfer equation

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = a \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}
$$

The equation of the displacment in a wave over time can be given by a PDE,

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}
$$

And the Poisson equation, used in a wide variety of fields in physics.

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} = P(x,y)
$$
