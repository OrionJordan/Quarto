The tabular method can quickly calculate repeated integration by parts.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Example (Stop 1)\n\nThe following example will show the first 'stop' used in tabular integration.\n\nFind the solution to the following integral\n\n$$\n\\int x^2 \\sin(3x) \\, dx\n$$\n\nThis could be solved using our formula for integration by parts, but this results in a messy calculation using repeated integration by parts. In order to solve these problems faster, we will use the Tabular method.\n\nFirst, choose two terms to work with in the integral. We will choose $x^2$ and $\\sin(3x)$. We want to choose a term that will eventually default to $0$ after repeated differention. Place this term under the $D$ in your table, and the other term under the $I$. Draw a plus to the left of your terms.\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n & \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} x^2 \\hspace{0.25in} & \\sin(3x)\n\\end{array}\n```\nTo begin, we will differentiate the term under our $D$, and integrate the term under our $I$, then flip the sign.\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n & \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} x^2 \\hspace{0.25in} & \\sin(3x)\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} 2x \\hspace{0.25in} & \\frac{1}{3}\\cos(3x)\n\\end{array}\n```\nRepeating this process eventually gives us a $0$ in our $D$ column. This is our first stop, meaning we don't need any more steps.\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n & \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} x^2 \\hspace{0.25in} & \\sin(3x)\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} 2x \\hspace{0.25in} & -(1/3)\\cos(3x)\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} 2 \\hspace{0.25in} & -(1/9)\\sin(3x)\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} 0 \\hspace{0.25in} & (1/27)\\cos(3x)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n```\nMultiply the $n^{th}$ under the $D$ by the $(n+1)^{th}$ term under the $I$. Then add or subtract the product by the sign the the left of the $D$ column. This is the answer to our integral.\n\n$$\n\\int x^2 \\sin (3x) \\,dx = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2\\cos(3x) + \\frac{2}{9}x\\sin(3x) - \\frac{2}{27}\\cos(3x) + C\n$$\n\nAnd we're done!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Example (Stop 2)\n\nThe following example will show the second 'stop' used in tabular integration.\n\n$$\n\\int x^4 \\ln x \\,dx\n$$\n\nAlthough it seems obvious we should put $x^4$ under the $D$ column, we quickly realize that we cannot integrate $\\ln x$ without integration by parts. Because of this, we have no choice but to but $\\ln x$ under the $D$ column. Carrying on with our calculations\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n & \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} \\ln x \\hspace{0.25in} & x^4\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} x^{-1} \\hspace{0.25in} & (1/5)x^5\n\\end{array}\n```\nWe can quickly notice that $0$ will never appear under the $D$ column. This is where our second stop comes in. If we can easily calculate the integral of a rows product (That is, the product of terms under the $D$ and $I$ columns for a singular row) than we stop, and add the integral of that row to our diagonal solution.\n\n$$\n\\int x^4 \\ln x \\,dx = \\frac{1}{5}x^5\\ln x  - \\frac{1}{5} \\int x^{-1}x^5\n$$\n\nThis is formula for regular integration by parts, so unfortunately this didn't save us any time, but we still got the right answer!\n\n$$\n\\int x^4 \\ln x \\,dx = \\frac{1}{5}x^5\\ln x  - \\frac{1}{25} x^5\n$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Example (Stop 3)\n\nThe following example will show the third 'stop' used in tabular integration.\n\n$$\n\\int e^x \\sin x \\,dx\n$$\n\nIntegrating $e^x$ and $\\sin x$ are both easy. I'll choose to integrate $e^x$ for simplicity sake.\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n & \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} \\sin x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} \\cos x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} -\\sin x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} -\\cos x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\n\\end{array}\n```\nClearly this will go on forever without a $0$ under our $D$ column, or an easily integrable row. This introduces our third stop. Notice that our first and third rows only differ by a constant coefficient. When this happens, we write our diagonalization and our integral, stopping at the repeated row.\n\n$$\n\\int e^x \\sin x \\,dx = e^x \\sin x - e^x \\cos(x) - \\int e^x \\sin x \\, dx\n$$\n\nNotice how this is the same integral on the left and right hand of the equation.

$8$.\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n & \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n + & \\hspace{0.25in} \\arctan(2x) \\hspace{0.25in} & 8\\\\\n - & \\hspace{0.25in} 2/(1+4x^2) \\hspace{0.25in} & 8x\\\\\n\\end{array}\n```\n\nUsing our third stop and integrating the second row, we get\n\n$$\n\\int 8\\arctan\\left(2x\\right)\\,dx = 8x\\arctan(2x) - \\int \\frac{8x}{1+4x^2}\n$$\n\nApplying a
