The most important class of formal language is known as [**first-order language**]{style=\"color: blue\"}, denoted $\\mathcal{L}_1$.\n\nThe symbols in a first-order language can be grouped into seven categories. Some authors may however chose to group the symbols into more or less categories, but the disctintion is arbitrary. These categories are\n\n-   **Connectives -** $\\land, \\lor, \\implies, \\iff, \\lnot$\n\n-   **Quantifiers -** $\\forall, \\exists$\n\n-   **Variables -** $v_1$,$v_2$,$v_3$ ect. A first-order language may consist of any countable amount of variables.\n\n-   **Constants -** $c_0$, $c_1$, $c_2$ ect. A first-order language may consist of any countable amount of constants.\n\n-   **Operations -** A first-order language can consist of any amount of countable operations (functions) $f$ of any order.\n\n-   **Relations -** A first-order language can consist of any amount of countable relations $p$ of any order.\n\n-   **Parentheses -** Right $)$ and left $($. \n\nMost of the time $\\to$ will be used instead of $\\implies$, and $\\leftrightarrow$ instead of $\\iff$, as the symbols are smaller are easier to read. For readibility sake, parenthesis occur in different sizes, or occansionally as brackets. Commas are also inserted to make formulas easier to read, but are not a formal symbol. \n\nNow we can begin constructing the syntax for first-order languages.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Definition\n\nEvery variable or constant is a [**term**]{style=\"color: blue\"}.

It is very common in math to use a [**Hilbert System**]{style=\"color: blue\"}, which consist of a large number of axioms, and few to no rules of inferences.\n\nBelow is an example of a Hilbert System which describes first-order logic. \n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## FOL Deductive system example[^1]\n\n**Logical Axioms**\n\nThe first four axioms describe propositional logic, which is logic without quantifiers like $\\land$ or $\\lor$.\n\n**P1.** $\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi$\n\n**P2.** $\\phi \\rightarrow (\\psi \\rightarrow \\phi)$\n\n**P3.** $(\\phi \\rightarrow (\\psi \\rightarrow \\zeta)) \\rightarrow ((\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow (\\phi \\rightarrow \\zeta))$\n\n**P4.** $(\\lnot \\phi \\rightarrow \\lnot \\psi) \\rightarrow (\\psi \\rightarrow \\phi)$\n\nHere, $\\phi,\\psi$ and $\\zeta$ refer to formulas, as constructed from our language. Thus, P1 could represent $p \\rightarrow p$ or $(p \\land q) \\rightarrow (p \\land q)$. \nThis axiomitization is in no way unique, and in fact axiom P1 can be proven from P2 and P3.\n\nThe next three axioms allow us to manipulate quantifiers. \n\n**Q5.** $\\forall x\\,(\\phi) \\rightarrow \\phi[x:=t]$ (Meaning $t$ may be substituded for $x$ in $\\phi$)\n\n**Q6.** $\\forall x\\,(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow (\\forall x\\,(\\phi) \\rightarrow \\forall x\\, (\\psi))$\n\n**Q7.** $\\phi \\rightarrow \\forall x \\,(\\phi)$ (where $x$ is not free in $\\phi$)\n\nThese three axioms allow us to use the $\\forall$ quantifier. \n\nFor formal systems where equality is not defined as a relation, the following two axioms are necessary.\n\n**I8**. $x = x$ for every variable $x$.\n\n**I9**. $(x = y) \\rightarrow (\\phi(x) = \\phi(y))$\n\n**Rules of inference**\n\nRules of inference are used to deduce a true statement from a previous.
